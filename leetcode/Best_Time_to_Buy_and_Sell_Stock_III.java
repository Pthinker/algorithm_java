Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on 
day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two 
transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell 
	the stock before you buy again).


public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // Start typing your Java solution below
        // DO NOT write main() function
        if(prices==null || prices.length<2) return 0;

        
    }
}
