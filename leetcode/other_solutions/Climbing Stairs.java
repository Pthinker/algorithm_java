You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

    public int climbStairs(int n) {
		int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        arr[0] = 1;
        arr[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        	arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2];
        }
        return arr[n];
    }
