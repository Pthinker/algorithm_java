397. Integer Replacement

Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
Example 2:

Input:
7

Output:
4

Explanation:
7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or
7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1


//When n is even, the operation is fixed. The procedure is unknown when it is odd. When n is odd it can be written into the form n = 2k+1 (k is a non-negative integer.). That is, n+1 = 2k+2 and n-1 = 2k. Then, (n+1)/2 = k+1 and (n-1)/2 = k. So one of (n+1)/2 and (n-1)/2 is even, the other is odd. And the "best" case of this problem is to divide as much as possible. Because of that, always pick n+1 or n-1 based on if it can be divided by 4. The only special case of that is when n=3 you would like to pick n-1 rather than n+1.
public class Solution {
    public int integerReplacement(int n) {
        if(n==Integer.MAX_VALUE) return 32; //n = 2^31-1;
        int count = 0;
        while(n>1){
            if(n%2==0) n/=2;
            else{
                if((n+1)%4==0&&(n-1!=2)) n++;
                else n--;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
