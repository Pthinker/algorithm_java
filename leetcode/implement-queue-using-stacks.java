232. Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).


public class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<>();  
    Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<>(); 
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        s1.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        if(!s2.isEmpty()) return s2.pop();  
        else {  
            while(!s1.isEmpty()) s2.push(s1.pop());  
            return s2.pop();  
        }
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        if(!s2.isEmpty()) return s2.peek();  
        else {  
            while(!s1.isEmpty()) s2.push(s1.pop());  
            return s2.peek();
        }
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.empty() && s2.empty();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.peek();
 * boolean param_4 = obj.empty();
