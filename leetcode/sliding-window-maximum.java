239. Sliding Window Maximum

Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, ie: 1 ≤ k ≤ input array''s size for non-empty array.

Follow up:
Could you solve it in linear time?

Hint:

How about using a data structure such as deque (double-ended queue)?
The queue size need not be the same as the window’s size.
Remove redundant elements and the queue should store only elements that need to be considered.

		}
		int n = nums.length;
		int[] r = new int[n-k+1];
		int ri = 0;
		// store index
		Deque<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
			// remove numbers out of range k
			while (!q.isEmpty() && q.peek() < i - k + 1) {
				q.poll();
			}
			// remove smaller numbers in k range as they are useless
			while (!q.isEmpty() && nums[q.peekLast()] < nums[i]) {
				q.pollLast();
			}
			// q contains index... r contains content
			q.offer(i);
			if (i >= k - 1) {
				r[ri++] = nums[q.peek()];
			}
		}
		return r;
    }
}
